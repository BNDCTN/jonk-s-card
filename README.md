Web-app with gallery

1) To build this app you need to install Node.js and npm.
2) Run Node.js command prompt and go on folder of this project by console commands.
3) Run 'npm install' in Node.js command prompt to install all dependencies that described in "package.json" file.
4) After completion of previous step run 'npm run build' in Node.js command prompt to build app.

P.S. Run this app on XAMPP server or some analogue. In this version I use ajax-jquery to load files from folder on server.
